- beautify main page, remove arrow icon
- photo in appbar should be tied to profile picture
- add transaction to card
- think how to make this relationship, each transaction must be unique but tied to a car (maybe just simple list<model> will work)
- card edit page/see transactions add graphs and card details (maybe slide between graph and card image (maybe use lib))
- CRITICAL fix project structure, everything is a mess, profile in home page, lack of controllers
